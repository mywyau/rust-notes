rustc --version
rustc main.rs          // create executable program
rustc ./main           // to run the program

cargo is rusts build tool/system
it will handle download and build dependencies, building your code etc.

cargo --version

cargo new hello_cargo       // creates a new directory called hello_cargo and make it a new project with a bunch of build files

rust packages of code are called crates

cargo build   //  will build your project but the main file as of current knowledge needs to be in /src

./target/debug/rust-notes    // to run your executable

cargo run  // is much simpler no need for cargo build

cargo check // checks code is compilable but does not build the executable


// we can build two versions of our app, one for dev and one for release
// release will have optimizations so will have a much longer compile time
cargo build --release
